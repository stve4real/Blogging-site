    <p>Poultry farms need a shelter for the birds, such as solid metal or mesh cages with sloped floors. The cages can be stacked or spread across the floor. </p>2
    
    <p><strong>Food and water</strong></p>

    <p>Birds need a proper atmospheric environment to prevent disease. The farm needs an energy source to control the temperature and lighting</p>

    <p><strong>Funding</strong></p>

    <p>Poultry farming requires a significant amount of capital to purchase land, equipment, food, and pay labor. </p>

    <p>It's recommended to have contacts with local broiler companies who will buy your birds before starting a broiler business</p>

    <p>Poultry farming can be profitable because of the high demand for poultry products. The manure produced by the birds can also be used to improve soil fertility. </p>
